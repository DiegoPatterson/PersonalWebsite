## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **New `files` Command**
- Shows complete filesystem command reference
- Lists all available files
- Provides quick start guide
- Different output per mode (DARK_AI vs SENTINEL_9)

### 2. **Case-Insensitive File Access**
- `cat README.txt` now works (was looking for lowercase before)
- `cat readme.txt` also works
- `cat Log_09.TXT` works too
- All commands now handle any case combination

### 3. **Better Discoverability**
- Help menu now mentions `files` command with 🔓 icon
- `files` added to Tab autocomplete
- Clear hint: "Type 'files' to access hidden system layers..."
