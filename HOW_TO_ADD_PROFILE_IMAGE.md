# How to Add Your Profile Image

## Steps:

1. **Save your profile photo** as one of these names:
   - `profile.jpg` (recommended)
   - `profile.png`

2. **Place it in this folder:**
   ```
   public/images/
   ```

3. **Full path should be:**
   ```
   Portfolio/public/images/profile.jpg
   ```

4. **The image will automatically display** when someone types:
   - `about me`
   - `profile`
   - `view profile`

## Tips:

- **Recommended size:** 400x400 pixels (square)
- **Formats supported:** JPG, PNG
- **File size:** Keep under 500KB for faster loading
- **Aspect ratio:** Square works best (1:1)

## Current image:
- The image you shared (guy in black shirt with burgundy tie) is ready to use!
- Just save it as `profile.jpg` in the `public/images/` folder

## Testing:

1. Add the image to `public/images/profile.jpg`
2. Refresh the site
3. Type `about me` in the terminal
4. Your profile photo will appear!

If the image doesn't show, check:
- File name is exactly `profile.jpg` (lowercase)
- File is in the correct folder: `public/images/`
- Try clearing browser cache and refreshing
