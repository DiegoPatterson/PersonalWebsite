      "description": "In the current Job market, many students and graduates worry about whether they could get a job or not in the field that they studied. Some look at the incoming jobs and just begin to lose hope, others spend time searching and getting denied without even knowing where they are going wrong. With so many resources on finding jobs yet little resources explaining the skill level of each, many are left searching without knowing what they are looking for. This is the problem that I look to solve with my research. I would like to train an AI to predict the direction of the entry level jobs in the job market, hoping to find out what skills and fields you should be focusing on and applying to get a job. Due to needing to predict the forecasted job demand over time, this will likely be a regressing problem, given that I wish to predict growth. To quantify when I have reached a successful point from my model, I will ensure that the regression model achieves at lease a 20% lower forecasting error (MAPE/RMSE) than a simple baseline predictor. This will be paired with a ranked list of entry-level AI roles that align with current industry insights. Finally, the results will be formatted in a way that will highlight what skills and roles are most associated with further growth.",
