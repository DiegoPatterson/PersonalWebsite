# EXAMPLE: New Vibe Project

NAME: Code Mood Ring
VIBE: ðŸŽ¨ Wholesome Tech
CATEGORY: AI
MOOD: ðŸŒˆ Feel-Good
GITHUB: https://github.com/diegopatterson/code-mood-ring
DESCRIPTION:
An AI that analyzes your code commits and determines your emotional state
while writing them. It then generates a color and mood for each commit.

Built this after noticing my commit messages get increasingly unhinged
during late-night coding sessions. The results are hilariously accurate.
Now I have a visual timeline of my emotional journey through projects.

BUILT_WITH: GPT-4, Sentiment Analysis, Color Psychology, Regret
