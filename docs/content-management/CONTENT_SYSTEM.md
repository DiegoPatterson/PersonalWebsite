## üîÑ Workflow

### To Add New Content:
1. **Create a text file** with the format above (e.g., `new-experience.txt`)
2. **Send it to me** and say "Add this to my portfolio"
3. **I'll convert it** to the proper JSON format
4. **Done!** It will appear in the correct mode automatically

### To Update Content:
1. **Send me the updated text** (just the changed parts)
2. **Specify what to update** (e.g., "update my Neural Adversary project")
3. **I'll make the changes**

### To Reorganize:
- Just tell me which items should be AI vs CYBER
- I'll move them to the correct category
