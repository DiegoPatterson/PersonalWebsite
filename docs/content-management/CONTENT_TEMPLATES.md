## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't forget commas between items:**
```json
{
  "id": "proj001",
  "name": "Project"  // ‚Üê Missing comma!
  "category": "AI"
}
```

‚úÖ **Do add commas (except before closing bracket):**
```json
{
  "id": "proj001",
  "name": "Project",  // ‚Üê Comma here
  "category": "AI"    // ‚Üê No comma here (last item)
}
```

‚ùå **Don't use single quotes:**
```json
{ 'id': 'proj001' }  // ‚Üê Wrong!
```

‚úÖ **Do use double quotes:**
```json
{ "id": "proj001" }  // ‚Üê Correct!
```

## üöÄ Quick Add Workflow

1. Open `vault.json`
2. Find the array you want to add to (experience, projects, etc.)
3. Copy template from this file
4. Paste INSIDE the array brackets `[ ]`
5. Fill in your information
6. Add comma after previous entry if needed
7. Save file
