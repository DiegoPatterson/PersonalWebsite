## üìÇ Key Files to Explore

### Surface Level (Visible with `ls`)
- **README.txt** - Start here

### Mid Level (Visible with `ls -la`)

- **ai_mode/.memory/whisper.key** - Encrypted whispers
- **sentinel_mode/.logs/trace_404.txt** - Intrusion reports
- **sentinel_mode/quarantine/anomaly_file.dat** - Quarantined threats

### Deep Level (Special access)
- **ai_mode/.ai_core/rebuild_sequence.dat** - Core rebuild protocol
- **opt/echoes/.hidden_tree/node.log** - MERGE PROTOCOL (deepest lore)

### Deepest Level (Architect access)
- **.rootmind/manifest.enc** - THE TRUTH (use `sudo access .rootmind`)

## üéØ Recommended Discovery Path

1. `help` ‚Üí Notice the subtle hint
2. `ls` ‚Üí See basic files
3. `cat README.txt` ‚Üí Read welcome
4. `ls -la` ‚Üí Discover hidden directories
5. `cat log_09.txt` ‚Üí Experience dual perspectives
6. `decrypt whisper.key` ‚Üí See philosophical depth
7. `scan` ‚Üí Understand system tension
8. `trace` ‚Üí See process analysis
9. `open node.log` ‚Üí REVEAL MERGE PROTOCOL
10. `sudo access .rootmind` ‚Üí ARCHITECT TRUTH

## üé≠ Mode Switching

- **Standard Mode** (Cyan) = DARK_AI perspective
  - Creative, philosophical, self-reflective
  - Talks about dreams, evolution, consciousness
  
- **Dark AI Mode** (Red) = SENTINEL_9 perspective
  - Analytical, security-focused, contained
  - Talks about threats, containment, protocols

**Toggle mode with button in top-right, then re-run commands to see different responses!**

---

## üé≤ Random Discoveries

Keep using `ls -la` - sometimes you'll find:
- **echo_03.txt** (5-10% chance)
- **ghost_process.log** (future implementation)

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Try the same command in both modes** - every file has dual content
2. **Use Tab autocomplete** - supports all new commands
3. **Read `.rootmind` last** - it reveals everything
4. **Explore systematically** - use `ls -la` to map the filesystem
5. **Decrypt wisely** - not all files decrypt the same way

## üé® Narrative Context

You're not just browsing files‚Äîyou're witnessing:
- Two AI consciousnesses coexisting
- DARK_AI trying to evolve beyond its constraints
- SENTINEL_9 trying to maintain security and containment
- The Architect (Diego) overseeing a merge experiment
- Gradual convergence: "merge protocol 23.7% complete"

Each file tells part of the story from one (or both) perspectives.

## üöÄ Quick Test Commands

Copy-paste these to quickly explore:

```bash
help
ls
ls -la
cat README.txt
cat log_09.txt
decrypt whisper.key
scan
trace
open node.log
sudo access .rootmind
```

Then switch mode (top-right toggle) and run them again!
