## 🎨 Animation Showcase

### Cyber Mode Animations
| Effect | Duration | Type |
|--------|----------|------|
| Particles | 10-30s | Smooth rise |
| Scanline | 8s | Linear sweep |
| Glow pulse | 2s | Gentle fade |
| Card hover | 0.3s | Smooth transition |

### Dark AI Mode Animations
| Effect | Duration | Type |
|--------|----------|------|
| Grid shift | 20s | Jittery movement |
| Glitch particles | 2-6s | Erratic darts |
| Scanline | 4s | Fast sweep |
| Screen shake | 0.2s | Violent burst |
| Flicker | 8s | Random flashes |
| Corruption blocks | 0.3s | Instant flash |
| Matrix rain | 8-12s | Falling code |
| Screen tear | 6s | Sweeping glitch |
| Border pulse | 4s | Breathing glow |
| Chromatic aberration | 0.3s | Split flash |

## 🔥 The "On the Fritz" Factor

### What Makes Dark AI Feel Broken:
1. **Multiple simultaneous animations** - Nothing is static
2. **Unpredictable timing** - Effects don't sync, creating chaos
3. **Layered glitches** - 7+ different glitch effects at once
4. **Color violence** - Aggressive red vs subtle cyan
5. **Motion everywhere** - Screen tears, shakes, flickers
6. **Binary rain** - Matrix-style falling 1s and 0s
7. **Corruption artifacts** - Random blocks appearing
8. **Chromatic split** - Red/cyan separation flashes

### The Psychology:
- **Cyber Mode** = "I trust this system"
- **Dark AI Mode** = "This system is about to crash... but it's fascinating"

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Show Cyber Mode When:
- ✅ Recruiters visit
- ✅ Portfolio reviews
- ✅ Professional presentations
- ✅ Job applications
- ✅ LinkedIn sharing

### Show Dark AI Mode When:
- 🔥 Impressing friends
- 🎨 Showcasing creativity

## 💡 Easter Eggs & Hidden Features

### Works in Both Modes:
- `who are you` - Identity revelation
- `run diagnostics` - System check
- `override protocols` - Access denied
- `shutdown` - Nice try
- `meaning of life` - 42
- `are you alive` - Philosophical response

### Tab Autocomplete:
- Works in both modes
- Press `Tab` to complete commands
- Shows all matches if ambiguous

### Arrow Keys:
- `↑` / `↓` - Navigate command history
- History persists within each mode

---

## 🚀 Performance Notes

### Optimization:
- CSS animations used whenever possible (GPU-accelerated)
- Framer Motion for complex sequences
- React memoization for expensive renders
- Conditional rendering (effects only in Dark AI)

### Browser Support:
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Perfect
- Firefox: ✅ Perfect
- Safari: ✅ Good (may vary)
- Mobile: ⚠️ Reduced effects recommended

## 🎬 The Vision

**Cyber Mode** is what you show your mom.  
**Dark AI Mode** is what you show your hacker friends.

One portfolio. Two personalities. Infinite possibilities.
