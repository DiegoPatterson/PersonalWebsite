# Mode Toggle Enhancement

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Image Issue
**Status:** ‚úÖ Identified
- Image exists at `public/images/profile.jpg`
- Image is valid JPEG (1915x4080 from Google Pixel 7)
- User compressed the image for better web performance
- Image should now load properly after compression

### 2. Added Clear Cybersecurity Mode Toggle

**Problem:** Users didn't understand that the dark mode toggle switches between AI/ML and Cybersecurity portfolios.

**Solution:** Added a prominent mode toggle button to the Quick Commands Panel.

#### What Was Changed:

**File: `src/components/QuickCommandsPanel.jsx`**
- Added `onModeToggle` prop to component
- Added prominent mode toggle button at the top of commands list
- Button clearly shows:
  - üîí "View Cybersecurity Portfolio" (when in AI/ML mode)
  - üîì "View AI/ML Portfolio" (when in Cybersecurity mode)
- Includes animated icon (‚ü≤) that rotates on mode switch
- Has hover effects and gradient backgrounds
- Separated from other commands with a divider line

**File: `src/App.jsx`**
- Passed `onModeToggle={handleModeToggle}` to QuickCommandsPanel
- Now both StatusBar and QuickCommandsPanel can toggle modes

## User Experience Improvements

‚úÖ **Clear Purpose** - Button explicitly says "View Cybersecurity Portfolio" or "View AI/ML Portfolio"

‚úÖ **Prominent Placement** - First item in Quick Commands Panel, impossible to miss

‚úÖ **Visual Feedback** - Hover effects, animated rotation icon, gradient backgrounds

‚úÖ **Two Access Points** - Can toggle from:
  1. StatusBar (top-right skull icon)
  2. QuickCommandsPanel (prominent button)

‚úÖ **Contextual Labels** - Label changes based on current mode, always showing what you'll see next

---

## Testing

To verify the changes work:

1. ‚úÖ Open http://localhost:5173/
2. ‚úÖ Look at Quick Commands Panel (right side)
3. ‚úÖ See the prominent mode toggle button at top
4. ‚úÖ Click it to switch between AI/ML and Cybersecurity modes
5. ‚úÖ Notice the button label changes based on current mode
6. ‚úÖ Check that content filters correctly (experience, projects, etc.)

## Benefits

**Before:**
- Users confused about what the skull icon does
- Unclear that it switches portfolio content
- Had to discover this feature by accident

**After:**
- Crystal clear: "View Cybersecurity Portfolio" button
- Prominent placement in Quick Commands
- Users understand they're viewing different portfolio content
- Makes the dual-portfolio feature obvious

## Technical Details

**Props Added:**
```jsx
const QuickCommandsPanel = ({ 
  darkMode, 
  onCommandSelect, 
  onModeToggle  // ‚Üê New prop
}) => {
```

**Button Implementation:**
- Uses Framer Motion for animations
- Gradient backgrounds that match mode theme
- Rotating icon (‚ü≤) with 180¬∞ rotation on mode switch
